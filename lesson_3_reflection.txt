1)When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer: When there are multiple people working on a project and need the access to the project code from different workstations. This helps in collaborating efficiently.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer: If first you need approval from the other collaborators of your project on the verification of the updated code which is being accesible to all on github. And once you have that approval you can update your local repository with the files from github repository.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Answer: Fork is bascially cloning the github repository from one user to your own github account. 
Cloning is bascically coping the repository with all the commit history from the github account to local host machine and from local host to loscal host.
Branching is totally different concept in which a branch of the exiting master is created. Whateever update is done in the branch is not reflected in the master until it is merged. Branching is used when we need to add new feature which we are not sure of. branches can be diicared or merged based upon the succeful implemnetation of the code.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Answer: The benifit is that we can merge the copy of the last known state of the remote stored and the last commit on the local host.

5)How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Answer: Easier: As git and git hub provides an extreme easy way to organize and develope your project with others and helps us to keep track of the all the changes made in the project.
Hard: All the concept of the push pull merge branch commit needs to be understand . A time invested at the start of  project will definitely hep in maintaining all future projects.

6) When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Answer: When we want acknowledgement from other contributers to merge it in master. Second scenario would be , when we want to work on a experimental feature that we are not sure will work.
Benefits are gives a very good way to separate the well established work and experimental work. Makes sure that merges are done only when all the contributors are agreed upon.
